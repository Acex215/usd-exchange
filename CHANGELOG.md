# 2.0.1

## Core

### Fixes

- The new `usd-exchange` Python Wheel which is published to PyPi is locked to our default USD 25.05
  - `pip install usd-exchange==2.0.1` strictly uses USD 25.05
  - If other USD flavors are required, please continue to use the `install_usdex` CLI tool or build from source
  - Rather than depend on the public `usd-core` wheel, we directly include the subset of OpenUSD libraries required to use `usdex.core`
    - `usd-core` is not ABI compatible with our minspec (manylinux_2_35 with modern CXX ABI)
    - In the future, if the public `usd-core` package becomes more compatible, we may add it as a dependency instead of packaging the OpenUSD libs
    - In the future, if wheel variants become possible on PyPi we may provide all supported flavors of `usd-exchange` as wheels

# 2.0.0

## Core

### Features

- Added USD 25.05 support
- Added Python 3.12 support for USD 25.05 and 25.02
- Added a new `usd-exchange` Python Wheel which is published to PyPi
  - There is a unique whl specific to each supported USD flavor/version (e.g. `usd-exchange==2.0.0+usd2505`)
  - Rather than depend on the public `usd-core` wheel, we directly include the subset of OpenUSD libraries required to use `usdex.core`
    - `usd-core` is not ABI compatible with our minspec (manylinux_2_35 with modern CXX ABI)
    - In the future, if the public `usd-core` package becomes more compatible, we may add it as a dependency instead of packaging the OpenUSD libs
- Added new `AssetStructure` module following NVIDIA's [Principles of Scalable Asset Structure](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/usd/latest/learn-openusd/independent/asset-structure-principles.html)
  - Includes new `defineScope`, `defineReference`, and `definePayload` functions for basic asset structure best practices
    - These functions ensure the new prim is defined at an editable location & that relative `AssetPaths` are used whenever possible
  - Includes more advanced functions for authoring according to the Atomic Component structure from the article
- Added new `PhysicsJointAlgo` module to simplify the authoring process
  - Supports authoring for fixed, revolute (hinge), prismatic (slide), and spherical (ball) joints
  - Ensures `PhysicsJoints` are aligned to both bodies when defined and can also re-align joints using `alignPhysicsJoint`
  - Abstracts the local joint frame to a form more suitable for a variety of source data specifications
- Added new `PhysicsMaterialAlgo` module for defining physical materials, adding physical properties to visual materials, and bindings physical materials to collision geometry
- Added `GfQuatf` orientation overloads to `XformAlgo` to accommodate a [translate, orient, scale] `XformOpOrder`
- Added overloads to all `XformAlgo` functions which accept `Xformable` schema
  - Allows call sites to replace the annoying `setLocalTransform(mesh.GetPrim(), ...)` pattern with `setLocalTransform(mesh, ...)`
- Added overloads to all `define` functions which "re-define" an existing `Scope`,  `Xform`, or untyped `Prim` to the specified prim type
  - Enables a two phase "define the structure, then fill in the details" pattern
- Added `kilogramsPerUnit` to the required Stage Metrics for `createStage` and `configureStage`
  - Call sites do not need to change, as it will be authored at a default value of 1 when `massUnits` is not specified
- Added `getLayerAuthoringMetadata` to retrieve previously authored creator metadata
- Added `getDiagnosticLevel` for mapping `TfDiagnosticType` to `usdex::core::DiagnosticsLevel`
- Added `USDEX_VERSION_STRING` macro to `Version.h`
- Added `buildVersion()` and changed behavior of `version()` (see Breaking Changes below)

### Fixes

- Prevent `bindMaterial()` from allowing bindings across instance boundaries
- All `PointsBased` define functions now emit `TF_RUNTIME_ERROR` if the points array is empty
- Fixed default `time` bindings in all `XformAlgo` functions
  - Runtime behavior is unchanged, it is just technically correct in the code now

### Breaking Changes

- Dropped USD 23.11 support
  - The source code may still compile for this flavor, but it is not being maintained in CI nor distributed as binary artifacts
- `usdex_core` now links `kind`, `work`, and `usdPhysics` directly
  - `usdPhysics` is the only new runtime requirement; the others were indirectly linked previously
- Replaced the sidecar `omni_transcoding` library with an internal implementation in `usdex_core`
  - The `USDEX_ENABLE_OMNI_TRANSCODING` `TfEnvSetting` was renamed `USDEX_ENABLE_TRANSCODING`
  - The behavior is unchanged, but build & distribution scripts need to be updated to avoid linking the other library
  - Note there is not currently any public function to decode an identifier
- `version()` now returns the simple semantic `USDEX_VERSION_STRING`
  - Use the new `buildVersion()` to retrieve the full `USDEX_BUILD_STRING` with semver and metadata
- Changed `hasLayerAuthoringMetadata` to accept a `const SdfLayerHandle` rather than a non-const `SdfLayerHandle`

## Pybind

### Features

- Added pybind11 interoperability for `Gf.Quatd`, `Gf.Quatf`, `UsdGeom.Scope`, `UsdGeom.Xformable`, `UsdPhysics.Joint`, `UsdPhysics.FixedJoint`, `UsdPhysics.RevoluteJoint`, `UsdPhysics.PrismaticJoint`, `UsdPhysics.SphericalJoint`

## RTX

### Features

- Added overloads to all `define` functions which "re-define" an existing `Scope`,  `Xform`, or untyped `Prim` to the specified prim type
  - Enables a two phase "define the structure, then fill in the details" pattern

### Breaking Changes

- `usdex_rtx` now links `usdGeom` directly

## Test

### Features

- `usdex.test` and `omni.asset_validator` can be used via the new `usd-exchange` wheel via the optional "test" extras
  - `pip install usd-exchange[test]`
- Added level filtering to `ScopedDiagnosticChecker`, which can be used to ignore status messages while still asserting warnings and errors
- Added `TestCase.tmpDir()` which is useful for structured asset testing
- The new `omni.asset_validator` module includes some optional `numpy` implementations which improve performance if `numpy` is available in the environment

### Fixes

- Fixed `usdex.test` to properly bootstrap `omni.asset_validator` when used outside of the `repo_test` harness
- Fixed `TestCase.tmpFile()` directory caching issue

### Breaking Changes

- The new `omni.asset_validator` module also requires the `omni.capabilities` module
  - Both modules ship in the same package & install via the optional `test` group for the `usd-exchange` wheels and for the `install_usdex` CLI
- `DefineFunctionTestCase` asserts the new "redefine `Prim`" overloads exist for each define function
- `DefineFunctionTestCase` now serializes `self.rootLayer` rather than using an anonymous layer
- Inlined `compareIdentifiers` in `usdex/test/FilesystemUtils.h`

## Dev Tools

### Features

- An `omni_asset_validate` CLI is included when using the `usd-exchange` wheel with the optional "test" extras (e.g. `pip install usd-exchange[test]`)
- `repo_version_header` now outputs a `<namespace>_VERSION_STRING` macro alongside `<namespace>_BUILD_STRING`

### Fixes

- Fixed `install_usdex` to use a fully qualified packman remote name
- Fixed `repo_version_header` to error when `macro_namespace` is unspecified, to prevent accidental un-namespaced macros

## Documentation

- Re-wrote the Getting Started guide as a minimal first step using Python Wheels
- Moved Try the Samples to a dedicated guide which follows the new Getting Started guide
- Moved Native Application Development to a dedicated guide
- Moved Testing and Debugging to a dedicated guide
- Added Python Wheels to the Deployment Guide and changed Docker deployment to use the wheels
- Added Physics and Asset Structure sections to the USD Authoring Guide

- Replaced social media links with more relevant links to GitHub and developer.nvidia.com/usd
