# OpenUSD Exchange SDK

# Overview

[OpenUSD Exchange SDK](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/usd-exchange) accelerates [OpenUSD](https://openusd.org) adoption, by helping developers create unique, customized USD I/O solutions that produce consistent and correct USD assets in any 3D ecosystem.

It provides convenience middleware on top of lower-level USD concepts, so developers can quickly adopt OpenUSD best practices, without needing to understand all aspects of OpenUSD.

# Get Started

To start using OpenUSD Exchange SDK see [Getting Started with OpenUSD Exchange SDK](docs/getting-started.md).

## Downloading or Building

We provide precompiled binaries of OpenUSD Exchange SDK, as well as all dependencies required to compile, link, and run a program that uses the OpenUSD Exchange libraries and modules. Additionally, OpenUSD Exchange SDK is source available and is licensed for modification & re-distribution (see our License Notices).

To download the precompiled OpenUSD Exchange SDK binaries and all the necessary dependencies:
  - Download or clone the [OpenUSD Exchange SDK repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/usd-exchange)
  - Navigate to your local `usd-exchange` directory
  - Run `./repo.sh install_usdex` or `.\repo.bat install_usdex` to download & assemble the OpenUSD Exchange SDK runtime requirements into a dedicated folder.

For more details on choosing build flavors & features, or different versions of the SDK, see the [repo_install_usdex documentation](docs/devtools.md#repo_install_usdex).

If you would like to modify it, or build it against your own OpenUSD distribution, see CONTRIBUTING.md to learn about building from source.
